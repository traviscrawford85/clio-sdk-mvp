    \nA community-driven [Clio Developers Stack Overflow Group](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/clio-api)\
    \ also exists where you can connect and ask questions from other Clio API users.\n\
    # Getting Started\n> **Note:** The API is available in four distinct data regions:\
    \ Australia (au.app.clio.com), Canada (ca.app.clio.com), EU (eu.app.clio.com)\
    \ and US (app.clio.com).\n>\n> Likewise, the developer portal is available at\
    \ region-specific links for the [Australia](https://au.developers.clio.com), [Canada](https://ca.developers.clio.com),\
    \ [EU](https://eu.developers.clio.com), and [US](https://developers.clio.com)\
    \ regions.\n>\n> This document assumes the US region is being used (app.clio.com).\
    \ If you're building in one of the other regions, you should adapt the links and\
    \ examples as necessary.\n\nTo start building on the Clio API, you\u2019ll need\
    \ a Clio account \u2013\_you can review our [Developer Handbook](https://docs.developers.clio.com/)\
    \ and follow the steps to sign up for an account.\n\nOnce you have an account,\
    \ you can [create a developer application](https://docs.developers.clio.com/api-docs/applications)\
    \ from the [Developer Portal](https://developers.clio.com) and start building!\n\

    # Minor Versions\nAPI v4 supports multiple minor versions. Versions are of the\
    \ form '4.X.Y'. To request a specific version, you can use an `X-API-VERSION`\
    \ header in your request, with the header value set to the API version you're\
    \ requesting. If this header is omitted, it will be treated as a request for the\
    \ default API version. If the header is present but invalid, it will return a\
    \ `410 Gone` response. If the header is present and valid, but it is no longer\
    \ supported, it will return a `410 Gone` response.\n\nAn `X-API-VERSION` will\
    \ be included in all successful responses, with the value being set to the API\
    \ version used.\n\nYou can find our [API Versioning Policy and Guidelines](https://docs.developers.clio.com/api-docs/api-versioning-policy)\
    \ in our documentation hub.\n\nThe [API Changelog](https://docs.developers.clio.com/api-docs/api-changelog)\
    \ explains each version's changes in further detail.\n- 4.0.4\n\n  Update `quantity`\
    \ field to return values in seconds rather than hours for Activities\n\n- 4.0.5\n\
    \n  * Remove `matter_balances` field from Bills\n  * Standardize status/state\
    \ enum values\n  * Add a Document association to completed DocumentAutomations\n\
    \  * Add rate visibility handling for Activity's price and total\n\n- 4.0.6\n\n\
    \  Remove `document_versions` collection field from Documents\n\n- 4.0.7\n\n \
    \ Change secure link format\n\n- 4.0.8\n\n  * `Activity` hours are redacted in\
    \ the response based on the activity hours visibility setting for the user\n \
    \ * Add `quantity_redacted` field to activities\n\n- 4.0.9\n\n  **This is the\
    \ default version**\n\n  Contacts are filtered and redacted in the response based\
    \ on the new 'Contacts Visibility' user permission setting.\n\n- 4.0.10\n\n  Fixed\
    \ validation of `type` query parameter when querying Notes\n\n\n"

          If you want to use more than one operator to filter a custom field, you

                              Multipart upload supports upload a single file as a
                              set of parts.

                              Each part is a contiguous portion of the data.

                              A `part_number` uniquely identifies a part and also
                              defines its position within the document being uploaded.

                              Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the
                              last part.

                              There is no minimum size limit on the last part.

                              The API handles maximum 50 `multiparts` in one request.
                              If the upload is split to more than 50 parts,

                              make a PUT request with `fully_uploaded` equal to `false`,
                              and another set of part numbers.

                              Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the

                              Each part is a contiguous portion of the data.

                              last part.

                              make a PUT request with `fully_uploaded` equal to `false`,
                              and another set of part numbers.
