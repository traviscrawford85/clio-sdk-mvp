    description: 'The part number of multipart upload. It must be an integer between
      1 to 10,000, inclusive.  Multipart upload supports upload a single file as a
      set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the data. A `part_number`
      uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the document
      being uploaded. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.
      There is no minimum size limit on the last part.  The URLs of multipart upload
      are returned in the field, `put_url`, with the corresponding `multipart`  The
      API handles maximum 50 `multiparts` in one request. If the upload is split to
      more than 50 parts, make a PUT request with `fully_uploaded` equal to `false`,
      and another set of part numbers. '

      can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the part data is the

      the Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check.
